## v1.00 Feature: First public release of Plotbot

### Summary
First push to the new `plotbot-v1` repository on GitHub (Sonified/plotbot-v1). Fresh version numbering starts at v1.00 to mark the beginning of the public release era.

### Major Decisions
- **Repository name**: `plotbot-v1` (lowercase, following GitHub conventions)
- **Version reset**: Jumped from internal v3.80 to v1.00 for the public release
- **Clean slate**: New repo rather than carrying over old git history

### Context
- Previous cleanup (v3.80) reduced repo from 751→362 files, 171MB→25MB
- This push represents the culmination of that cleanup work
- Ready for Zenodo DOI and ApJ paper reference
